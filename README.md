# Nice places

This is a map that displays nice places on Helsinki. It uses the heatmap visualization, so expect everywhere that has a color to be nice or beautiful in some way. The data is taken from a [Helsinki Region Infoshare dataset](https://hri.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/helsingin-kansallinen-kaupunkipuisto-kyselyn-vastaukset) that contains answers from a survey that ran in the fall of 2017. Only some categories are included on this map, specifically the ones that denote nice, beautiful or interesting places.

## Functionality

Click the map to open Google Maps and navigate to the place you clicked. I wanted a simple and no-nonsense way to find cool places to photograph and this is it.
